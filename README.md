# Coverage Validation Action

A fast, Docker-based GitHub Action for validating test coverage from XML files against minimum thresholds. This action eliminates the need to install dependencies like `libxml2-utils`, `bc`, and other tools in your workflows.

## Features

- ✅ **Fast execution** - Pre-built Docker container with all dependencies
- ✅ **Multiple formats** - Supports Clover, Cobertura, and JaCoCo XML formats  
- ✅ **Configurable thresholds** - Set minimum coverage percentages
- ✅ **Clear output** - Colored logs and detailed error messages
- ✅ **GitHub Actions integration** - Outputs for use in other steps

## Supported Coverage Formats

| Format | Description | Example Tools |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `clover` | Clover XML format | PHPUnit, Jest, Vitest |
| `cobertura` | Cobertura XML format | pytest-cov, coverage.py |
| `jacoco` | JaCoCo XML format | JaCoCo (Java) |

## Usage

### Versioning

This action follows semantic versioning with convenience tags:

- `@v1` - Latest v1.x.x release (gets all updates, including new features)
- `@v1.0` - Latest v1.0.x release (gets patch updates only)
- `@v1.0.4` - Exact version (no automatic updates)

**Recommended:** Use `@v1` for most use cases to get the latest improvements and security updates.

### Basic Usage

```yaml
- name: Validate Coverage
  uses: vln-devsecops/actions-validate-coverage@v1
  with:
    coverage-file: 'coverage/clover.xml'
    minimum-coverage: '80'
```

### Advanced Usage

```yaml
- name: Validate Coverage
  uses: vln-devsecops/actions-validate-coverage@v1
  with:
    coverage-file: 'coverage/coverage.xml'
    minimum-coverage: '85'
    coverage-type: 'cobertura'
    working-directory: './backend'
```

### Using Outputs

```yaml
- name: Validate Coverage
  id: coverage
  uses: vln-devsecops/actions-validate-coverage@v1

    coverage-file: 'coverage/clover.xml'
    minimum-coverage: '80'

- name: Comment on PR
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
    script: |
      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,

        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body: `❌ Coverage validation failed! Actual: ${{ steps.coverage.outputs.coverage-percentage }}%`
      })
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|

| `coverage-type` | XML format type (`clover`, `cobertura`, `jacoco`) | ❌ | `cobertura` |
| `working-directory` | Working directory for the coverage file | ❌ | `.` |

## Outputs

## Migration Guide

### From manual xmllint commands

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Validate coverage
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-utils
    COVERED=$(xmllint --xpath "string(/coverage/project/metrics/@coveredstatements)" coverage/clover.xml)
    TOTAL=$(xmllint --xpath "string(/coverage/project/metrics/@statements)" coverage/clover.xml)
    COVERAGE=$(echo "($COVERED * 100) / $TOTAL" | bc | awk '{print int($1)}')
    if [ "$COVERAGE" -lt "80" ]; then
      echo "Coverage $COVERAGE% is below 80%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Validate coverage
  uses: vln-devsecops/actions-validate-coverage@v1
  with:
    coverage-file: 'coverage/clover.xml'
    minimum-coverage: '80'
```

## Development

### Local Testing

```bash
# Run the unit test suite
bats tests/validate-coverage.bats

# Test the script directly
./validate-coverage.sh examples/clover.xml 80

# Build and test Docker image
./scripts/test-docker.sh

# Build Docker image manually
docker build -t validate-coverage .

# Test with a sample coverage file
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/examples:/workspace validate-coverage \
  /workspace/clover.xml 80 clover
```

### Publishing

```bash
# Manual publish to GHCR (for initial setup)
./scripts/publish-docker.sh

# Create a release (automated pipeline)
./scripts/create-release.sh 1.0.0
```

**Important**: The release script automatically updates action.yml to reference the specific version Docker image (e.g., `ghcr.io/vln-devsecops/actions-validate-coverage:v1.0.0`), ensuring reproducible releases.

### VS Code Tasks

The project includes VS Code tasks for development:
- **Build Docker Image**: Builds the Docker container
- **Test Coverage Script**: Tests the script directly
- **Test Docker Action**: Tests the Docker action
- **Test Docker (All Formats)**: Comprehensive Docker testing
- **Publish Docker to GHCR**: Manual publish to registry
- **Create Release**: Streamlined release creation
